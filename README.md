Presentation date: 5/2/2024
Project: Design and implement a publication-listing service.

The Final Project will involve creating a database, with functionality based on the topic that has been approved by the instructor.
Teams will be composed of two students and they will present their database interface, along with a slide presentation describing the functions. The presentation days will be scheduled randomly, per team, by the professor.

Requirements:
  - MySQL database with appropriate tables, keys, relations, etc.
  - ER Diagram that describes your database (MySQL Workbench can help you with that)
  - User Interface (web-browser or some form of GUI) to manipulate the database (to enter, delete, modify, search the data)
  - One page paper describing your database functions in detail
  - 3-5 slide presentation, which will accompany your class demonstration

What to submit (all zipped):
  - MySQL database file and supporting interface files/application
    - Database and supporting files must be zipped and submitted to Canvas. If you prefer to implement remotely (repl.it, PHP, GitHub, etc.), you must provide the link and full access to the database file
  - ER Diagram
  - Paper
  - Slide presentation
